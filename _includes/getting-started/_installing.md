## Installing Swift

If you don't have Swift installed, [install it first](/install).

To test that you have Swift installed, run `swift --version` from your shell or terminal app.

Swift comes bundled with the [Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM)]({% link documentation/package-manager/index.md %}), which manages the distribution of your Swift code, and allows easy importing of other Swift packages into your apps.
